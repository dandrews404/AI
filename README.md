# CS-370
This repository covers my final project for SNHU CS-370

In this project, I created an AI that would play a treasure hunt game that would seek out a certain tile in a larger board. The code that I created was a deep Q network that would learn more and more about the game each turn, this code was located in the def qtrain function. The code provided for me was everything else.

Next moving on to what I have learned from this course in terms of the larger field of computer science.
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? Computer scientists design, create, and update the code that is used to make almost every electronic we use functional.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? I break down the problem into an ipo (inputs, processes, and outputs) then I write out a plan in pseudo-code, then I write out the code for the program.
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? To put it simply, I have a responsibility to let the user know what the program is doing to their device and their data. I also have a responsibility to harvest and keep as little user data as possible as well as make sure the information I do have is properly secured.
